/*
Output prime numbers
importance: 3
An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.

P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.
